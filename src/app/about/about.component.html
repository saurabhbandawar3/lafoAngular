  <!--<h3>Purpose</h3>-->
  <!--<p>Welcome to LostAndFound.com, the largest and most comprehensive website devoted exclusively to the recovery of pets and-->
    <!--personal property. Our sole purpose is to reunite lost and found pets and property to their respective owners using the dynamic-->
    <!--communication channels provided by the Internet. What could be more satisfying than returning the family dog or engagement ring to their-->
    <!--respective owners?</p>-->

  <!--<h3>Description</h3>-->
  <!--<p>LostAndFound.com (The Internet Lost and Found (ILF)) offers visitors a convenient, one-stop source for the exchange of lost-->
    <!--and found information including the most comprehensive online database of lost and found pet and property listings, photos,-->
    <!--resources, advice, and support tools, on the internet. LostAndFound.com offers this information on a local, national and international basis.-->
    <!--It features a variety of categories and services that aim to provide users with the necessary tools (some of which are uniquely suited to the-->
    <!--Internet) for the effective communication of lost and found information</p>-->

  <!--<h3>Ad Features</h3>-->
  <!--<p>Features available for Ads on LostAndFound.com include:</p>-->

  <!--<h4>Email Matching Service</h4>-->
  <!--<p>LostAndFound.com offers a matching service that "matches" the consumer's lost database ad with information entered into our-->
    <!--found database by other users. Closely relevant results are sent by email to the consumer, who can view-->
    <!--the found ad to determine its pertinence.</p>-->

  <!--<h4>Reward Incentive</h4>-->
  <!--<p>LostAndFound.com believes that providing an incentive by offering a reward for lost pets or property is an important instrument-->
    <!--for recovery. Particularly today, when one can measure the value of lost data as greater than the economic value of the device that-->
    <!--contains it, a reward can be the paramount motive for recovery. Not to mention the sentimental value of a-->
    <!--lost pet! LostAndFound.com provides consumers with the ability to put a reward icon on the results page,-->
    <!--and provides the reward amount on the ad details page. The consumer is responsible for the reward.</p>-->

  <!--<h4>Photos</h4>-->
  <!--<p>They say a picture is worth a thousand words. In terms of identifying a pet or piece of property,-->
  <!--a photograph provides essential information that words cannot convey. Consumers can upload a photo for use with their ad on the Ad Detail Page,-->
    <!--the Ad Results Page, or as a "Featured Ad". (see below)</p>-->

  <!--<h4>Ad Enhancements</h4>-->
  <!--<p>In order to create greater visibility for a particular lost ad, LostAndFound.com offers the following ad enhancements:</p>-->

  <!--<h5>Highlighting and Bolding</h5>-->
  <!--<p>Consumers can highlight or bold their lost ad on the Results Page to make their ad stand out.</p>-->

  <!--<h5>Featured Ad Listings</h5>-->
  <!--<p>Consumers can have their lost ad placed at the top of the Results Page for all local search queries.</p>-->

  <!--<h5>Featured Ad Homepage</h5>-->
  <!--<p>Consumers can have their lost ad rotate on the front page for maximum exposure. When clicked, Featured Homepage Ads will direct the-->
    <!--viewer to the lost ad's Detail Page.</p>-->

  <!--<h5>Venues</h5>-->
  <!--<p>LostAndFound.com offers a venue page for public locations to effectively create an "online lost and found box".-->
    <!--Rather than have searchers peruse listings for a whole city or country, the Venue Page allows individual locations to set up their own lost and-->
    <!--found information online. This information is blended with the main database for all universal searches, however, only data specific to the-->
    <!--venue is listed on the venue page. Venues can direct and report lost and found information quickly and efficiently using this tool.</p>-->

  <!--<h5>Mobile App</h5>-->

  <!--<p>LostAndFound.com can go mobile using the LostAndFound.com Mobile App! Use the mobile app to recovery your mobile device when lost,-->
    <!--or use it to interact with your LostAndFound.com Venue Page. Using the mobile app, employees can efficiently upload real time information-->
    <!--to their venue page and send out ALERTS to mobile app users for lost and found reports. Personal functionality includes mobile recovery-->
    <!--(mapping, gps locating, and sensory alarms) as well as PIN (pinning a loss event on a map), radial alerts, and more! Check it out at-->
    <!--www.lostandfound.com/app</p>-->

  <!--<h5>Partnership Opportunities</h5>-->
  <!--<p>We are always looking to expand our reach.-->
    <!--Please contact us at bizdev@lostandfound.com to inquire about partnership opportunities.</p>-->
